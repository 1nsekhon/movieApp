### Notes
When I first began the project for this week, I actually had a pretty easy time. I was following the Walkthrough videos and everything was working pretty well and the project was having successful builds. But, when I tried to import "AlamofireImage", create a pod, and code through the workspace, I all of a sudden got 100+ errors preventing my app from running. Because of this, I decided to reinstall the pod and go through each step very carefully. Unfortunately,the explosion of issues were still present. I sent a message in the #ios-help-fall20 slack channel where both a TA and Tim Lee helped me work through the problems. It ended up just being a compatability issue so I had to fully update XCode and my Macbook which sadly ended up taking about 20 hours to be fully implemented.
